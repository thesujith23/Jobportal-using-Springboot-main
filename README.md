## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   JDK 17 or later
-   Maven
-   Node.js and npm
-   PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/thesujith23/Jobportal-using-Springboot-main.git](https://github.com/thesujith23/Jobportal-using-Springboot-main.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Jobportal-using-Springboot-main
    ```
3.  **Configure the Backend:**
    -   Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
    -   Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties to match your PostgreSQL database configuration.
    -   Build the project using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    -   Run the Spring Boot application:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    -   The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

4.  **Configure the Frontend:**
    -   The React frontend code is located within the project. You would typically run it in a separate terminal.
    -   (Assuming a standard React setup) Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd path/to/your/react-app
        ```
    -   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    -   Start the development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    -   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository contains the complete Spring Boot application. The React frontend code is typically managed within this structure or in a separate repository.

-   `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java source code (controllers, services, repositories, models).
-   `src/main/resources`: Includes configuration files (`application.properties`) and static assets.
-   `pom.xml`: The Maven project object model file, defining dependencies and build settings.
